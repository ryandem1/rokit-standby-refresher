# Rokit Standby Refresher
Inspired by: https://janeisklar.net/2018/10/03/rokit-krk-auto-standby-deactivation-with-software/

If you are an owner of the KRK Rokit Speakers, you might struggle with the auto-standby feature where they turn off after a certain period of time if they do not have a sound going through them past a certain volume threshold. Unfortunely, this volume threshold is quite high, so if they turn off, you need to play a rather loud sound to get them to turn back on again...

RMAS, at the link above, was great, it allowed you to simply play a low frequency sound at a certain time interval...it is unfortunately only for windows and I could not find a Mac equivelent in my 5 seconds of searching Google.

This is a simple MacOS menu bar application that will play a low frequency sine wave every 10 minutes (with a manual button to play the sine wave on demand). It is not as customizable as RMAS, but it gets the job done for me, and I think the sine wave I used is a little smoother than the one in RMAS, which has a sort of "pop" sound. It is low enough so that it is barely audible with just the rokit monitors...a subwoofer might change that though
